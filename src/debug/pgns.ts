I have been playing the Classical Sicilian almost exclusively for some time now, and with a lot of success, so it seemed like an easy decision that this should be what I recommend. I had not played it much before 2020, but now that I have added it to my repertoire, I really wonder why I had largely avoided it for so long. I think it is one of the best possible lines to play for a win with the black pieces, as it leads to dynamic, unbalanced positions without nearly as much forcing theory as other Sicilians, such as the Najdorf and the Sveshnikov. The only issue I take with it is that I think White has a very slightly better chance of proving an objective advantage than some other lines, such as the Petroff, Berlin, or Najdorf. But, I am okay with that. In general, I think the Classical is a lot better than its reputation. The more sound an opening gets, the more theory there will be. This is always the case. And I think the Classical Sicilian sacrifices only a little less soundness for a lot less theory. Additionally, I like how dynamic the positions are. It strikes me as a very healthy balance. Some lines in the Berlin and Petroff are mind-numbingly boring and dull, leading to incredibly dry positions that are very hard to play for a win. By comparison, lines like the Najdorf and Sveshnikov are so direct and forcing that the game has a high tendency to fizzle out to nothingness just a few moves outside of preparation, and in some cases forced lines can be memorized some 30 moves deep and beyond. I find the Classical Sicilian to be a healthy, happy middle-ground. As always, I have done my best to address any recommendations I can find in chess literature advocating 1.e4 for White, and to provide appropriate antidotes. Additionally, I have done my best to explain the strategic themes as clearly as possible. This is always a good idea, but I find it to be uniquely important when dealing with very non-forcing positions, where the difference in evaluation between the best move and the second-best move is not very notable. There are a lot of positions like this in the course, much more so than any other course I have done before. The lines covered in the course are all noted here in the introduction. } 1.e4 { This was my first ever game in an Olympiad. } 1...c5 { At this juncture, White’s most challenging move by far is 2.Nf3 , leading to the Open Sicilian. I’ve always believed that playing anti-Sicilians with White is one of the best possible ways to limit yourself as a chess player because it not only gives up the fight for the opening advantage early on, but also deprives one of the opportunity to play the most beautifully dynamic and complicated middlegames in all of chess. As such, people who avoid 2.Nf3 and 3. d4 on a consistent basis tend to not reach their full potential as chess players. That said, it is our duty to play well with the black pieces regardless of what move comes from our opponents, and there are a lot of Anti-Sicilians to be ready for. In general, I think 2.c3 and 2.Nc3 deserve their own files, and this one will start off with all of the total nonsense. } 2.Nf3 { 2.Nc3 One big appeal of the Classical is that Black can comfortably play Nb8-c6 here rather than d7-d6, making 2.Nc3 a significantly less annoying move order than it would be against the Najdorf. 2...Nc6 3.g3 3.f4 g6 g6 2.c3 Nf6 2.b3 g6 2.a3 g6 } ( 2.d3 { This move was once tried against me by Richard Rapport. I guess White’s plan is to play some kind of Closed Sicilian without committing to Nb1-c3, but it shouldn’t be too troublesome. } { This move was once tried against my by Richard Rapport. I guess White’s plan is to play some kind of Closed Sicilian without committing to Nb1-c3, but it shouldn’t be too troublesome. } 2...Nc6 3.g3 ( 3.f4 { This has been tried from time to time, with the plan of playing Ng1-f3 and developing the bishop to e2 rather than g2. It’s not totally stupid but also hardly intimidating. } 3...g6 ( 3...d5 4.Be2 Nf6 5.e5 Ng8 ) 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Be2 { Now, I see no reason not to go for the same development scheme. } 5...e6 6.O-O Nge7 7.c3 O-O 8.Be3 b6 { Black looks totally fine to me. Bc8-b7 comes next and there isn’t anything to be scared of. } ) 3...g6 { I like playing the same kind of setup that we will see against the Closed Sicilian. White can play Nb1-c3 at any moment, which will be a direct transposition, but in this chapter, we are looking at what happens if he avoids it. } 4.Bg2 Bg7 { Transposes } 5.f4 { Now, I quite like the idea of omitting d7-d6 altogether. } 5...e6 6.Nf3 Nge7 7.O-O O-O ( 7...d6 { This seems unnecessary. 7...O-O ! 8.c3 b6 Black doesn’t need d6.

White’s queen gets to f4 and will give mate. We can forgive Richard for not finding this. } 33...Bxg4 34.Re1 Nd5 { Now things are not so easy. Black’s position is surprisingly solid, the e-pawn is really good, and Rc1 is coming. } 35.Kg2 { This move looks very natural, but Richard had missed a key point. } 35...Rc1 36.Rxc1 Rxc1 37.Ba6 e2 38.Bxe2 Bxe2 39.Qd7 { It looks like White is finally finishing the game off since now that the bishop is no longer on g4, Rc8-c7 would fail to Ng5xe6+.

But I don’t think it is a necessary move because Black probably wants to develop the bishop to b7. } 8...b6 9.d4 ( 9.Be3 Bb7 10.Nbd2 { A position like this one will be very dull for awhile as it is hard for either side to do much to improve their position, but that’s fine for Black. His first goal is to equalize, and he has clearly done so. } 10...d5 { This strikes me as a good moment for the d7-d5 advance, as if White responds with e4-e5, then d5-d4 will come. Black is totally fine and can look to the future with confidence. } ) 9...cxd4 10.cxd4 Bb7 { A position like this one is a good illustration of why d7-d6 strikes me as a waste of time. What would it accomplish? Black is ready with moves like Ra8-c8, Nc6-a5, and f7-f5 to pressure White’s center. In fact, the absence of d7-d6 makes the f7-f5 break easier to pull off thanks to the e6 pawn remaining defended. Black looks absolutely fine to me. } ) ( 2.b3 { Among all of White’s alternatives to the mainline with 2.Nf3 and the 2 main anti-Sicilians in 2.c3 and 2.Nc3, this move is probably the most dangerous option. I still find it less than frightening. } 2...g6 { Black has other good moves, but this strikes me as the simplest. Basically, all throughout the course, whenever g7-g6 is a decent option, I always choose it, even in positions where plenty of other moves are fine as well, such as this one. } ( 2...Nc6 3.Bb2 Nf6 4.e5 ( 4.Nc3 g6 ) 4...Nd5 5.Nf3 g6 ) 3.Bb2 Nf6 { Black need not fear the doubled pawns or the e4-e5 push. } 4.e5 { For obvious reasons, this is the main move. } ( 4.Qf3 { This has been played a bunch as well, but it is unimpressive. } 4...d6 5.Bb5+ Nbd7 { Black will be clearly better if he can play Bf8-g7 and O-O. In practice, White has taken on f6 just about every time, doubling the pawns and weakening the d5-square, but this does not solve his problems either. } 6.Bxf6 exf6 { Now, the only thing Black really needs to know is not to waste any time on the tempting move a7-a6. Just go Bg7 and castle. } 7.Qd3 { This has been tried too, strictly as prophylaxis against Bf8-g7. I suppose it makes some sense, but the bishop will not be bad on e7 either. } ( 7.Nc3 Bg7 8.Nge2 O-O { The strategic threat of Nd7-e5 more or less forces White to take on d7. 8...a6? This tempting move is very wrong, as White had to take on d7 voluntarily anyway if Black has castled instead. 9.Bxd7+ Bxd7 10.O-O O-O 11.Nf4! Black is probably still okay, but White got a much stronger clamp down on the position than I would have liked. } 9.Bxd7 Bxd7 { Bd7-c6 and f6-f5 are coming, when all of a sudden Black’s bishops will be amazing. } ) 7...Be7 { Again, not wasting time on a7-a6. } 8.Nc3 ( 8.Nf3 { This sad move is probably White’s best, anticipating that Nd7-e5 will be a serious problem. But Black is doing quite well here too. } 8...O-O 9.O-O Nb6 { Black overprotects the d5-square and gets ready for f6-f5 next. He already looks a bit better to me. } ) 8...O-O { Once more, the strategic threat of Nd7-e5 forces White to take on d7 voluntarily. } 9.Bxd7 Bxd7 10.Nf3 ( 10.Nge2 f5 11.O-O fxe4 12.Qxe4 Bc6 13.Nd5 Re8 { Black’s bishops look really good.

White more or less has to push e5-e6 here, as otherwise Black will be able to castle and easily surround the e5-pawn. } 7.e6 f6 8.exd7+ Nxd7 { Once more, I already prefer Black thanks to his big center, and White’s pieces look less than stellar. In particular, I really do not see much future for the b2-bishop. } ) ( 5.d4 { This is tricky, but Black is in good shape after a surprisingly important check. } 5...Qa5+ { Before taking on d4, Black makes sure to disturb White’s coordination. } 6.c3 ( 6.Qd2 Qxd2+ 7.Nxd2 cxd4 { Black has easy play and is already better. The e5-pawn will be hard to maintain. } ) 6...cxd4 7.Qxd4 Nc6 { Since the d5-knight is not hanging, this move is possible. And White is obviously worse. } ) ( 5.Nc3 { This move is relatively rare, but probably best. } 5...Nxc3 6.Bxc3 ( 6.dxc3 { Modern chess at its finest. White spends 2 tempi to get the bishop to b2, and then blocks it in. But this move is definitely best.

The main reason for this is that a7-a6 is not a wildly useful move. For example, after 6.a3 Despite White making a less than critical move, Black still should probably avoid g7-g6. This will lead directly to the Dragon with the inclusion of a2-a3 and a7-a6. I don’t think this is massively in Black’s favor or anything like that. By contrast, if Black had played Nb8-c6 instead of a7-a6, he is much more able to successfully transition into a Dragon. } { One nice thing about the Classical Sicilian is that it allows Black to transpose to the Dragon next move with g7-g6 against a lot of white’s extraneous tries. The best setup for White against the Dragon involves f2-f3, Bc1-e3, and Bf1-c4 is optional. Against any of these moves, I don’t think going for a kingside fianchetto is too clever. But most other sidelines can be comfortably met with g7-g6, including every one in this chapter. } { Transposes to our normal Open Sicilian. } { This game was the last time I played the Classical Sicilian before I picked it up again in 2020.

The main reason for this is that a7-a6 is not a wildly useful move. For example, after 6.a3 Despite White making a less than critical move, Black still should probably avoid g7-g6. This will lead directly to the Dragon with the inclusion of a2-a3 and a7-a6. I don’t think this is massively in Black’s favor or anything like that.

In general, I believe Black’s most harmonious development scheme is with g7-g6, Bf8-g7, O-O, and Nb8-c6. Black will have a very compact position, no weaknesses, and very active pieces. The only issue is the Yugolav Attack, where White plays Bc1-e3, f2-f3, Qd1-d2, Bf1-c4 is optional, castles long, and throws the h-pawn down the board to go deliver mate. Black is then harmed by his pawn hook on g6, and often finds himself crushed. 5.f3 Again, we see that the Classical is an excellent opening to play against Anti-Sicilians. Najdorf players often find this position annoying since after Nb8-c6 White can play Nb1-c3, forcing them into a Classical instead.

O-O 8.Qd2 Nc6 With O-O-O here, or Bf1-c4 first and then O-O-O, White has a very dangerous attacking plan with h2-h4-h5. Black can find his king in tremendous peril very quickly. This plan is important to remember. If Black plays Nb8-c6 on the fifth move and White makes a move that is not part of this plan, then Black can nearly always play g7-g6 to transpose to a good version of the Dragon. 5...a6 If Black plays the Najdorf, he has not completely abandoned the plan of fianchettoing the king’s bishop and it is seen in some lines, but it is not the main idea and he generally cannot switch to a Dragon setup too easily. The main reason for this is that a7-a6 is not a wildly useful move. For example, after 6.a3 Despite White making a less than critical move, Black still should probably avoid g7-g6. This will lead directly to the Dragon with the inclusion of a2-a3 and a7-a6. I don’t think this is massively in Black’s favor or anything like that. By contrast, if Black had played Nb8-c6 instead of a7-a6, he is much more able to successfully transition into a Dragon. } { One nice thing about the Classical Sicilian is that it allows Black to transpose to the Dragon next move with g7-g6 against a lot of white’s extraneous tries. The best setup for White against the Dragon involves f2-f3, Bc1-e3, and Bf1-c4 is optional. Against any of these moves, I don’t think going for a kingside fianchetto is too clever. But most other sidelines can be comfortably met with g7-g6, including every one in this chapter. } { Transposes to our normal Open Sicilian. } { This game was the last time I played the Classical Sicilian before I picked it up again in 2020. I was happy to win a nice game against someone who frequently plays the same line from the Black side. } 6.Bg5 { I believe this is far and away White’s most challenging move. It serves a few purposes. First off, g7-g6 is no longer a thing, for obvious reasons. Secondly, Black is discouraged from playing e7-e5 thanks to the weakness of the d5-square. Finally, after 6.f3 This is a somewhat annoying move in that Black cannot comfortably play g7-g6, but after 6...e5! I think Black is totally fine. 6.Bc4 Here as well, we cannot play g7-g6 as White will be able to transpose to the mainline Dragon. 6...Qb6! Black should be fine here as well. The bishop loses a lot of time. 6.g3 A move like this one, which is inconsistent with the Yugoslav Attack, is well met with g7-g6. 6...g6 6.f4 g6 Ditto the g3 note. 6.Be2 g6 Here as well, Black is very happy playing g6 because White’s Bf1-e2 does not mesh with the Yugoslav attack. 6.Be3 Ng4! This is a good way to make Bc1-e3 fall on its face. } { As I mentioned in the introduction, I believe 6.Bg5 is by far the most challenging line for Black to face when playing the Classical Sicilian. As this chapter shows, even the sidelines within 6.Bg5 before reaching the absolute main position following 7.Qd2 and 8.0-0-0 are much tougher to deal with than any of the sidelines White could play on the 6th move. } ( 6.g3 { I never understood why people play such meager lines. I feel as though Black is always fine if White calmly develops and castles short, and only the castle long plans have any hope of fighting for an advantage.

His main plan will generally be to first play Bc8-d7 and then push for a7-a6 and b7-b5. If White ever retreats his d4-knight to b3, the bishop tends to sit nicely on e6 instead, even if it costs Black a tempo on Bc8-d7 and only then Bd7-e6. Finally, is is important to note that the inclusion of a7-a6 and a2-a4 tends to be in Black’s favor since his bishop on e6 can then always take a knight on b3 without letting White recapture towards the center with axb3. } 9.Qd2 { This is the most common choice. } ( 9.Nb3 a6 { Transposes to the 8.Be3 line. } { It is important to include a7-a6 and a2-a4 before committing the bishop to e6. } 10.a4 Be6 { A good rule of thumb is that Black’s bishop is very well placed on e6 if White ever plays Nd4-b3.

His position plays itself with Bf8-e7 and O-O next, the threat of Nf6xe4 hanging over White’s head prevents him from putting his queen on the ideal e2-square, and I would already prefer Black here.

Despite silicon skepticism, I regard Black’s position as fully playable. } 12.Bb3 Qc7 13.f4 O-O-O { Wei Yi has played a sideline that some modern engines think is dangerous for Black. But from a human point of view, it feels so much easier to play Black here with the clear plan of d6-d5 next, the big center, the bishop pair, and the b3-bishop being less than stellar. Grischuk made it look easy. } 14.Rhf1 d5 { Of course. } 15.Qe2 Kb8 16.a3 h5 { I like this move, gaining space on the kingside and preventing the queen from reaching h5. } 17.Kb1 h4 18.f5 Rde8 { 18...Qe5 Black could have gone here immediately. } 19.Rf3 Qe5 { Black’s center is very solid. Wei Yi found nothing better than allowing a queen exchange, but this really will not help his cause. } 20.exd5 { 20.Qf1 This is the machine’s recommendation, hanging the e4-pawn. Who plays chess like this? After 20...Reg8 It prefers White, and I have no idea why. } 20...Qxe2 { Throughout the course, we see a lot of positions where Black has a big center and a somewhat loosened king’s position. In general, queen trades are welcome in these situations. } 21.Nxe2 exd5 22.c4 d4 { Well spotted. } 23.Ba4 { 23.Nxd4 c5! } 23...c5 24.Rb3 Rc8 25.Nf4 Bd6 26.Nd5 Ka7 27.Rh3 Be5 { White is done for. } 28.Rd2 Rhd8 29.Rxh4 Bxd5 30.cxd5 Rxd5 31.Rh7 Rc7 32.Be8 Rd8 33.Ba4 c4 34.Ka2 d3 35.Rh4 Rb8 36.Re4 c3 37.bxc3 Bxc3 ) 10...d5 { Black takes his share in the center, making ample use of recapturing b7-xc6. He already looks better to me. } ) ( 8.Be2 { This move has been seen from time to time, but it strikes me as mixing plans in a weird way. } 8...Bd7 9.O-O Nxd4 10.Qxd4 Be7 { Black is absolutely fine in a typical Sicilian middlegame, and can hope that eventually his more compact pawn structure and the misplaced knight on c3 will become relevant. It’s very rare for White to put the Sicilian under any serious pressure by castling short, and this position is no exception. } ) 8...Bd7 { Now, the two main moves by far are f2-f3 and f2-f4, each of which has their own entire chapter. But White does have a couple extraneous tries that merit some attention. } 9.f3 { In recent years, the f2-f3 advance has been more common than the old mainline of f2-f4. White aims to transition the game into some kind of English Attack. Black’s setup is not the best against what would be a traditional English Attack, but here there is the very notable difference that White’s bishop is on g5 rather than e3, which is a much bigger detriment than it might look at first glance. Of course, White did not have a choice in the matter as 6.Be3 and 6.f3 allow Black resources to avoid a structure like this one. The big point is that it is a lot harder to get g2-g4-g5 in. If White plays g2-g4 with his bishop still on g5, he will often be hit with h7-h5 in response, but if he ever ducks the bishop back to e3, h7-h5 may come all the same. } ( 9.f4 { At long last, we are in the absolute main line. f2-f4 has somewhat taken a backseat to f2-f3 in recent years, but I still regard it as the most critical move. } 9...Be7 { In recent years, this simple developing move has gained some traction. Black remains flexible. In some cases he will just castle short next, while in others he might look for queenside play instead. } { Historically, a7-a6 has been much more popular, but in recent years, this simple developing move has gained some traction. Black remains flexible. In some cases he will just castle short next, while in others he might look for queenside play instead. } 10.Nf3 { This is the main move by a wide margin, but White does have a couple extraneous tries. He now is threatening e4-e5. } ( 10.Be2 { This is White’s second most common choice, but I can’t say I find it wildly impressive. The bishop does not do much here. } 10...h6 11.Bh4 b5 12.Bf3 Rc8 { Black’s position looks quite healthy to me. He has a compact structure, no major weaknesses, and Bf1-e2-f3 seems to have not accomplished very much. Raunak Sadwani has tried playing this way a couple times from the White side, aiming to transition into an endgame by taking on f6, but I find it unimpressive. } 13.Nxc6 Bxc6 14.Bxf6 Bxf6 15.Qxd6 Qxd6 16.Rxd6 Be7 { With g7-g5 to come next, I believe Black is absolutely fine in the resulting endgame. We see a lot of lines like this one where Black loses the d6-pawn but White has to exchange off his dark squared bishop for a knight and remove the queens to get it, and the resulting endgames tend to be very playable despite the pawn less. } ) ( 10.Nb3 { This has been seen from time to time as well, but it strikes me as a poor version of Nd4-f3. The knight often feels misplaced on b3 in the Sicilian and this position is no exception-I don’t really see much future for it apart from the d4 square, which it just left. Black can play the same way as he would in the mainline. } { As mentioned in the course, I find this move inoffensive compared to the mainline with Nd4-f3. } 10...b5 11.a3 ( 11.Bxf6 gxf6 12.f5 ( 12.Ne2 Qb6 13.g3 h5 14.Ned4 O-O-O { White has sort of moved around aimlessly so far, and has not been able to put any pressure on the e6-pawn with f4-f5. It’s remarkable how easily a position like this one can turn south. } 15.Bg2 Kb8 16.Nxc6+ Bxc6 17.Qd4 { This is a really bad decision. Black is nearly always happy to trade queens whenever he has played g7xf6. The bigger center will matter more in the endgame, and the less safe king will likely cease to matter at all. 17.f5 This should be preferred, aiming to pressure the e6-pawn. But after the simple 17...Bb7 Black’s position looks pretty solid to me. He has any number of plans available to him, the most natural looking being b5-b4 and a6-a5 to gain queenside space and harass the misplaced knight on b3. } 17...Ka7 { 17...Qxd4 I would not have given White a chance to change his mind! } 18.Qxb6+ { Continuing along the wrong path. } 18...Kxb6 19.Nd4 Bb7 20.Bf3 { The endgame is totally miserable for White. } 20...h4 21.g4 Bf8 22.Rhf1 Bh6 23.Ne2 h3 24.Rd3 e5 25.Kd1 f5 { I’m not sure this was necessary. 25...a5 Black could have done this as well, looking for b4 and Ba6.

I don’t think White has much hope to harass the e6-pawn, and plans with f4-f5 against the Sicilian tend to me much more effective when the bishop is on b7 rather than d7. Since this is not the case here, Black should be very comfortable. } 10...b5 { Not only does this move gain space on the queenside and look for counterchances, it also stops White’s bishop from getting to c4, which I think is the only way he could really justify the f4-f5 push. Black can castle next and eventually play Nc6-e5, and his position looks very healthy to me. } ) 10...b5 { A thematic Sicilian idea. If White pushes e4-e5, Black is now ready with b5-b4 in response. At this juncture, White has three main ways of playing, all of which reach totally different positions. He can immediately go for e4-e5 to provoke immediate complications and change the nature of the game immediately, he can try a2-a3 to prevent b5-b4 and try to push through e4-e5 next, or he can take on f6 and force Black to accept the typical Rauzer pawn structure. } 11.a3 { I tried this move in 2019 against Parham Maghsoodloo. While I think it is objectively not as good as the mainline, it is a very, very dangerous move if caught unprepared and I won a very quick game. White’s point is that he is going to push e4-e5 next at a moment when Black will not be able to respond with b5-b4. As such, since the knight on c3 will not be booted away, Black will not be able to use the d5-square for his own knight on f6. Black is not in time to castle, and e4-e5 is coming next move. Extreme care must be taken. } ( 11.e5 { This is White’s most direct move, immediately forcing a resolution of the tension. Of course Black should be ready for it, but it strikes me as less challenging than the other two tries. } 11...b4 { An important move. Black secures the d5-square before resolving the tension. White should probably take on f6 to avoid allowing the enemy knight to land on its happiest home. } 12.exf6 ( 12.Ne2 dxe5 13.fxe5 Nd5 { Black is ready to castle next. The knight on d5 keeps the center closed for just long enough to allow his king to evacuate, and White’s position is full of weaknesses and his pieces do not coordinate very well. } ) ( 12.exd6 { This spirited move is not totally senseless, but I don’t buy it. } 12...bxc3 13.Qxc3 Bf8 { Black is ready for Qd8-a5 to come sooner rather than later, and I don’t believe White is fast enough to open the center and crush Black before the extra piece counts. In practice White’s results here have been lousy, and the computer confirms that Black is better. } ) 12...bxc3 13.Qxc3 gxf6 14.Bh4 { While Black was not yet threatening to take the bishop, it’s clear that sooner or later it will have to move anyway, so unsurprisingly the immediate retreat is the most common move by far. } ( 14.Rxd6 { A surprisingly large number of strong players have fallen for this trap, including an old coach of mine, GM Josh Friedel. As tempting as it may be to grab a pawn, White loses immediately. } 14...Bxd6 15.Bxf6 { It looks like White is winning his rook back, but... } 15...Bb4 { After this move, he can resign instead. } ) ( 14.Bh6 { The bishop might look menacing here, but it is only getting into trouble. } 14...Rg8 { Black is already threatening to win a piece directly with Rg8-g6, forcing White’s reply. } 15.f5 e5 { Black has a massive center and White is in no position to break it down. } 16.Bc4 { White’s most natural, and best move. Black needs to respect the threat of Bc4xf7+ with Qc3-b3 to follow. } 16...Na5 { The only move, harassing the bishop and preventing the queen from checking if White were to take on f7. } 17.Bd5 Rc8 18.Qd3 Rg4 { Black has a very comfortable position. His king is totally safe in the center, and his rook is ready to lift to the queenside. Moves like Bd5-b5, Qd8-b6, and Rg4-a4 will become very intimidating very fast. } ) ( 14.Kb1 Rg8 { White must play Bg5-h4 here anyway, transposing to the 14.Bh4 line. } ) 14...Rg8 { This move is quite rare, but probably best. Modern machines offer it, and despite its historical obscurity, it has been seen in 2020 by MVL against Nakamura. The most obvious point is to develop the rook to a nice square, but Black also has a more subtle idea. He’d like to play Qd8-a5 next without allowing Bh4xf6. Exchanging queens should definitely be in his favor since his king is a little skeptical in the long run and his central pawn majority would feel much more free to advance when it would not cause the monarch any danger. 14...Qa5?

This has to be the most challenging move. } ( 16.Bxa6 { Of course, Black needs to be ready if White grabs the pawn. He has a very important resource. } 16...d5 { A subtle, but very powerful move. There are a few points. First off, it is good prophylaxis against Ba6-d3, as then White’s queen will be in danger after a well timed Be7-b4. Second, Black now can look for Nc6-b4 and once the bishop leaves a6, he will be able to play Ra8-c8 without hanging the knight. } 17.Bd3 ( 17.g3 { This is the move I’d expect a human to play. } 17...Nb4 18.Bd3 { Now another point of d6-d5 is on full display. Black is able to move his rook on b8 without hanging the knight. } 18...Rc8 19.Qd2 Ra8 20.a3 Qb6 { According to the machine, the position should soon end in a draw by perpetual check.

Material is equal, he has good play on the queenside, and d5-d4 could be coming soon. } ) 17...Rg4 { White is already in bad shape.

But, White is hardly able to save the pawn. } 18.g3 Rxh4 { Black eliminates the h4-bishop, and now the e7-bishop is free to move without allowing f6 to get captured. } 19.Nxh4 Bb4 20.Qb3 Na5 { White loses his queen, and the game. } ) 16...a5 { In the game, Maxime tried Qd8-a5, but I was not thrilled with the endgame once White is able to take on a6. He did manage to save it, but I’m not sure he was equalizing. Now, Black has a different idea. He wants a5-a4, and then Qd8-a5 next, aiming for a similar endgame but without losing the a-pawn. 16...Qa5?! 17.Qxa5 Nxa5 18.Bxa6 This strikes me as dangerous for Black. I don’t like the two connected passers when the absence of queens means there won’t be any attacking chances. } 17.g4 { This feels like the most human move, but I find it unimpressive.

Black activates his rook and is ready to meet Qd2-g5+ with Ke7-f8 and does not have to worry about his rook being trapped out of play. Normally he would want to put the a-rook on c8 instead, but this is an exception due to the strategic threat of Qd2-g5. } 14.Rhe1 ( 14.f4 { This feels like the most natural move to me, preventing Nf6-e5. } 14...Rc4 { Black is very solid, and is not without counterplay. I would expect him to soon follow up with Ra8-c8, Qb6-c5, and b7-b5. If this can happen, I would think White’s king would be in more danger than Black’s! } ) 14...Ne5 15.b3 { A sad necessity. White did not want to allow Ne5-c4, but now he is much less secure on the c-file. } 15...Qc5 16.Kb2 Rc6 17.f4 Rac8 18.fxe5 Qxc3+ 19.Qxc3 Rxc3 20.exd6+ Kd7 { Despite the pawn down, Black is absolutely fine. Once White defends c2, Black can play e6-e5, and eventually round up the d6-pawn. } ) ( 13.f4 { I think this is White’s best move, though it strikes me as a far from obvious decision for a human to make. My instinct would be to keep the queens on the board when Black’s king is in the center. } 13...Qxd4 ( 13...Rac8 { Black needs one more move before he can transition into an endgame. Now, White really does need to respect the strategic threat to exchange the queens. } 14.Qxg7 ( 14.Qd2 Rc4 { Much like we saw against 13.Qd2, this setup works very nicely. Black is ready for Rh8-c8 next with good counterplay. } ) ( 14.Rhe1 Qxd4 { Now and only now, Black transitions into the endgame. } 15.Rxd4 a6 { The point is that because his rook is already on c8, He can keep the knight off of b5. } 16.Red1 Rc6 { And he has a much more active setup than he would if he had to defend the pawn from d8. In fact, Black is already slightly better! } ) ( 14.Qd3 { Another accurate move. White avoids the exchange of queens while not allowing Rc8-c4. This whole sequence strikes me as very difficult for a human to find. } 14...Qc5 { Black is ready for Rc8-c6, Rh8-c8, and b7-b5. The machines claim White is a little better after a very forcing sequence, but I do not buy it. } 15.Nb5 Rc6 16.e5 d5 17.Nd4 Rb6 { The position resembles a Steinitz French where Black was able to trade off the bad bishop. If he is allowed to play a quick Qc5-b4 and Nd7-c5, White’s position will quickly become very dangerous. } 18.a3 { Necessary prophylaxis. } 18...Rc8 19.Rhe1 { White’s queenside is reasonably secure, and f4-f5 could be coming. Black is well advised to get rid of the queens. } 19...Qc4 20.Qxc4 Rxc4 { The machines give White some advantage of 0.3 or so. Perhaps my optimism that they are wrong only reflects my own lack of understanding, but I really have no idea why Black would be worse here. He has no bad pieces, no weaknesses, and an easy plan to challenge the d4-knight with Nb8-c8 next. Similar endgames one might find in the French where both sides still have a light squared bishop would be a different story, but without the bad bishop, Black looks very fine to me. } ) 14...Rhg8 15.Qxh7 Qf2 { Despite the two pawns less, Black has a ton of threats and will promptly win back his material. The machine gives a lot of lines ending in equality, but I would be worried from the White side. } 16.g3 { A human move, but Black has a strong response. } 16...Nf6 17.Qh3 Rh8 18.Qf1 Qe3+ 19.Kb1 Rxc3 20.bxc3 Nxe4 { And White is rapidly losing control of the game. } ) 14.Rxd4 { Black is more or less okay here, but I think it is a bit more comfortable to play from the White side thanks to the extra space. In order to reach comfortable equality, Black needs to get a rook to c6 and a7-a6, stopping Nc3-b5. Here, he is not in time to pull that off, and has to resort to a somewhat more passive defense setup. } 14...Nf6 15.Rhd1 Rhd8 { I think Black should hold without a ton of trouble and it is certainly a playable alternative to the mainline, but I would rather not subject myself to this when a superior solution exists. } ) 13...Rhg8 14.Qxh7 ( 14.Qh6 Qxf2 15.Rd2 Qf6 16.Qe3 Qg5 { The position is very messy, but I don’t mind the Black side. He has a better structure and by far the better knight once it lands on e5, as its counterpart on c3 doesn’t have much hope for the future, but of course he always has to worry a bit about his king. At high depths, the machines call it equal, though I would think a draw might be the least likely result. } ) 14...Rh8 { An important resource. } 15.Qg7 Rag8 16.Qd4 Qxd4 17.Rxd4 Rxg2 { Black has taken back one of his lost pawns and will take back a second one in short order. He certainly is not worse in the resulting endgame. }"
