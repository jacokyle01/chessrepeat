{ We start off with a bit of history: the player behind the Black pieces, Marcus Kann, is responsible for 50% of the opening’s name that is the topic of this course ! In this game he defeats one of the leading players of his time. } { 14 rounds and almost 1 month later, the same players set down at the board and repeated the same line, again! } { Some background information around this game: going into the last round of their 14-game World Championship match, Peter Leko was leading with 7-6. Kramnik, with the white pieces, needed a win to level the score and keep the title - the defending champion had draw odds. Perhaps this game is the biggest stage that the Caro-Kann has ever seen. } { The setting is the World Rapid Championship in Riyadh. The player behind the White pieces needs no introduction and his opponent is the (at that time) 15-year old Andrey Esipenko. } 1.e4 c6 { Caro-Kann: A Lifetime Repertoire It is with great joy that I introduce the reader to the Caro-Kann Defence. World Champions like Anatoly Karpov and Mikhail Botvinnik played the Caro throughout their entire career, which should serve as a stamp of approval to make it our Lifetime Repertoire. I, Erwin l’Ami from the Netherlands, have been a grandmaster since 2005 and a professional chess player ever since. My most notable tournament victory was the 2015 edition of the Reykjavik Open and, dating back to 2006, I have been a member of the Dutch Olympiad team. But I am perhaps better known for my work as a second. A second helps another player come to the game as best prepared as possible. That means opening work, and a lot of it! For about three years I was part of Veselin Topalov’s team and the memories around Topalov’s 2010 World Championship match against Vishy Anand I still cherish to this day – despite the result! These days, I regularly help Anish Giri who is arguably the best prepared player in the world. Without doubt, the work for this course greatly corresponds with the work I have been doing as a second. Engines Engines changed the world of chess – and I will bypass the discussion whether they did in a good or bad way (bad, obviously) . As an ambitious 17 y.o. International Master I bought my first computer, at the time - state of the art. It had four whooping processors and I was proudly running the program Junior 6, which was hugely aggressive and would suggest the most ludicrous sacrifices. Developments have been rapid since those days and my phone would now defeat my sophisticated computer with disappointing ease. Just two years ago, the latest engine revolution hit the chess world when Google introduced its AlphaZero (A0) , which demolished the top program Stockfish 8 with considerable ease. A0 uses a neural network to play the game of chess which was a novelty in the world of chess engines. An open source project, based on Google’s technique, started soon after and nowadays Leela Zero (Lc0) can be used by any chess fan across the globe. The difference with Lc0 and Stockfish is that the former has incredible instincts, while the later calculates incredibly well. When using these two engines in the preparation of this course, Lc0 pointed out a multitude of new directions. The combination is the perfect analysis tool. The process Given the special times we live in I - like the majority of world’s population - spent most of my days indoors for the past few months. That gave me the opportunity to submerge myself into this project like I have never done before. I have quite literally woken up and fallen asleep with this course in mind. At times I thought the finishing line would never be in sight! You can be certain: the responsibility of handling a repertoire that lasts a lifetime is one I take very seriously! This is also a good moment to thank my wife Alina for the enormous contributions she has made in the creation of this course. Quick Pointers The course obviously covers the entire Caro-Kann, meaning all of White’s possibilities after 1.e4 c6. In two cases I have decided to give an alternative as well. Since this is a Lifetime Repertoire I think it’s a good idea to be able to switch things around. That’s why in the Advance Variation: @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@ 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 I have covered the conventional 3...Bf5 , as well as the alternative 3...c5 (Chapters1 -3.) The same applies to the Classical Variation: 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 where I, perhaps somewhat surprisingly to seasoned Caro-Kann players, have chosen 4...Nf6 as the main recommendation. At the same time, I covered themore popular 4...Bf5 as well and I leave it to the reader to decide which of the systems appeals more. I would recommend going through all the material before making that decision. Under the guidance of Lc0, the move4...Nf6 in the Classical Variation has truly undergone a metamorphosis! Everything related to the Classical Variation is covered in Chapters 4-8 and all other variations have gotten just one recommendation as they are not nearly as critical. I have tried to illustrate why I came to certain choices throughout the course and hope that I have been able to get those points across. Given the abundance of trainable lines, I have tried to limit the number of trainable moves, often cutting the line towards the end. That way I feel the course remains within acceptable boundaries. When going through the moves a bunch of arrows, circles and whatnot will appear on the board. I trust it will be easier when you just see it. A little guideline regarding the colours: yellow - indicates an idea for White red - points at something bad green - is used for Black’s plans. Discussions & Updates Finally, I am very curious what you think of the course. I hope we will have a lively Discussion Forum and I am always ready to answer any questions you may have. It is my intention to regularly update the course since opening theory has this annoying tendency to always move forward! Now without further ado, I would invite you to the Quickstarter Guide in order to get a peek into what we will be doing in this course. } { This course will be a full repertoire against 1.e4, based on the Caro-Kann. In this Quickstarter Guide I will give a rough overview of what you can expect but obviously I would refer you to the corresponding chapters for a (much) more detailed coverage. The Quickstarter Guide is created to show the framework of the entire repertoire. } { This course will be a full repertoire against 1. e4, based on the Caro-Kann.

A significant moment for its history was the year 1886, when Caro published an article in the Magazine ‘Bruderschaft’ featuring what is now known as the Caro-Kann Defence. Before the article was published, Markus Kann had played the opening successfully in Viennese chess circles and so the Chess World had to find a compromise: binding the two names gave birth to the Caro-Kann ! The list of top players who played this opening is interminable. It was one of Anatoly Karpov’s main weapons throughout his career and Mikhail Botvinnik used the opening when it mattered the most: in his matches against Mikhail Tal for the World Championship. Modern players who frequently use the Caro-Kann include Ding Liren, Vishy Anand, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, Veselin Topalov, Hikaru Nakamura and the list goes on and on. What makes all these players choose this particular opening ? I believe the reason to be twofold: Top players like to have a solid, reliable opening, and the Caro certainly serves that purpose. At the same time, top players also want an opening that offers them chances and the unbalanced nature of the Caro-Kann offers just that. This versatile opening has seen a bit of a change in personality over the past decades. Formerly known as a dull, solid opening, in the hands of modern players it changed into a perfect fighting weapon. The unbalanced nature of the position, where White has more space but Black no obvious weaknesses, often leads to strategically complex battles. It is my pleasure to be your guide while we discover the treasure trove that is the Caro-Kann Defence ! } { Capablanca often used the Caro-Kann. In the 22 games I found in the database, including a few simuls, he scored a staggering +12 with 10 draws ! } 2.d4 { The most logical reply.

First of all, 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 is not an option here, as 4...Nf6 !? is a better try, but I have been unable to equalize after 5.Qe2 5.Nxf6+ exf6 would be to our liking, as White has already misplaced the knight on f3. 5.Ng3 Bg6 Better would be 5...Bg4 but 6.h3 Bxf3 7.Qxf3 anyway gives White an easy advantage. 6.h4 is quite different with the knight being on f3, rather than the pawn on d4. Black is now in huge trouble since h6 7.Ne5 Bh7 8.Qh5 ! g6 9.Bc4 e6 10.Qe2 is a giant disaster. Pushing the d-pawn with 3...d4 4.Ne2 c5 wouldn’t be that bad, if not for 5.c3 ! Breaking up Black’s centre. 5.Ng3 h5 ! 6.Bc4 h4 ! is very unclear. 5...dxc3 5...d3 6.Nf4 c4 7.Qa4+ picks up all the pawns. 6.bxc3 Nf6 7.Ng3 with a big advantage. Very popular for a while was 3...Nf6 4.e5 Ne4 with games being played on the highest level, and with fine results for Black. 5.Ne2 Playing against the e4-knight. Qb6 6.d4 e6 7.Ng3 c5 8.Bd3 Nxg3 and until recently, everybody would take back on g3 with h-pawn when chances are dynamically equal. In 2019 however, MVL improved with 9.fxg3 ! A concept that more or less relegates 3...Nf6 to a dubious sideline. Following 9...cxd4 10.O-O Nc6 11.Qe2 h6 12.a3 Bd7 13.g4 Be7 14.b4 and White had a great position in Vachier Lagrave-Nakamura, Saint Louis 2019. It also showed the great tenacity of Nakamura who managed to steer the game towards a draw. White can play on both wings, depending on where the black king will be going, g4-g5 is there, as well as Rb1 followed by queenside action. In short, 3...Nf6 is out. } 4.h3 ( 4.Be2 { Simply preparing to castle can’t be an unhealthy approach. } 4...e6 5.O-O ( 5.h3 { 5.d4 Be7 !? 5...Nf6 6.h3 Bh5 7.e5 transposes to the note on move 6 and is a line I consider dangerous for Black.

In fact, the game continuation is also winning, but the almighty engine proposes the more convincing 39.g5 ! Kb4 40.Qf8 Qae7 41.Qff6 !! Nd1 42.Qb8+ Qxb8 43.Qxe7+ Kc3 44.g6 and there is no stopping the g-pawn. Obviously we can excuse Fischer for missing this and other things during and after the game.

The problem is the difference in king’s position. Black’s king has no shelter. 43.Qb8+ Nb5 44.Be2 threatens a check on d1.

Two titanic clashes between two icons of our game. These games were monumental for our understanding of this structure ! } ) 14.Nf3 { 14.c3 is what Fischer had prepared for their next game. White indeed seems to be better as the following lines indicate: 14...Qe7 Interesting is 14...h5 !? preparing h5-h4 and with the prophylactic idea that 15.f4 gxf4 16.gxf4 Nd7 17.Nc4 Qe7 sets up a blockade on e5 , while the pawn on h5 prevents the White queen from entering there. 15.Nf3 h6 16.cxd4 exd4 16...Nxd4 17.Nxd4 cxd4 18.Rac1 16...cxd4 17.h4 Rg8 18.hxg5 hxg5 19.Rfc1 O-O-O 20.b4 Kb8 21.b5 Na5 22.Qd2 ‘wins a pawn.’ 17.e5 !

It turns out White’s last move did not constitute any threat as 16.hxg5 hxg5 17.Nxg5 O-O-O followed by Rdg8, is horrible for White. } 16.a3 Qe7 17.hxg5 { Perhaps the immediate 17.Rab1 was preferable, preparing the b2-b4 push. } 17...hxg5 18.Qd2 Nd7 { 18...g4 19.Nh4 is a strategic mistake, closing down the kingside. The White knight now has a nice square on f5, which is one of the reasons why Fischer traded on g5: to be able to meet g5-g4 with Nf3-h4. } 19.c3 O-O-O 20.cxd4 exd4 21.b4 { In a desperate plea for counterplay. } 21...Kb8 { Very powerful is 21...c4 22.dxc4 ! Nde5 gaining total control over the position. After 23.Nxe5 Nxe5 24.c5 Qf6 ! White is already in big trouble. A sample line is 25.Rac1 25.f4 gxf4 26.Qxf4 Qg7 ! is hopeless for White. 25...Nf3+ ! 26.Bxf3 Qxf3 27.Qd1 g4 ! and wins because 28.Qxf3 gxf3 29.Rfd1 Rh8 30.Rd3 Rh3 31.Rxf3 Rdh8 costs White a full rook. The text move does not spoil much. } 22.Rfc1 Nce5 { But this move does tip the scales ! 22...g4 23.Nh4 Nce5 was the way forward, though 24.Rab1 Qg5 25.Qd1 keeps the game messy. Nevertheless, with such a powerhouse/horse on e5, Black is objectively better. } 23.Nxe5 Qxe5 { Again not best. Getting the knight to e5 was preferable, even at the cost of a pawn. 23...Nxe5 24.Rxc5 Rc8 25.Rac1 Rxc5 26.Rxc5 is still very unclear as the knight is far superior to the bishop and it’s hard for White to do much with the extra pawn. } 24.Rc4 Rc8 25.Rac1 { 25.Rb1 !? Rc7 26.a4 g4 27.a5 also came into consideration.

White likely holds the balance after 31...Rd7 32.c6 Rd6 33.cxb7 Rxc1 34.Qxc1 Kxb7 35.a5 followed by a6 and Qf4.

Basically, White will try to push as many pawns as possible on the fourth rank, from where he will slowly start to move them to the fifth rank. Black has to solve a number of problems. Where will he put his king ? How will he connect the rooks ? Evgeny decides to leave his king in the centre. If Black, for instance, castles kingside he will connect the rooks, but in all probability he will need his king back in the centre soon.’ - Kramnik.

Ne7 9.O-O when Black surely hasn’t equalized yet. } 8.dxc5 Bxc5 9.O-O Ne7 10.Na4 { 10.b4 !? was mentioned by various sources. This would have obviously caused an initial shock, but after that it transpires 10...Bxb4 10...Qxb4 11.Nb5 offers some play for the pawn. 11.Rb1 Qa5 12.Nb5 Nbc6 13.Nd6+ Kf8 doesn’t offer White much. } 10...Qc6 11.Nxc5 Qxc5 12.Be3 Qc7 13.f4 { ‘White’s outpost already causes him problems and does not bring any benefits’ did Tartakower observe at this point. It shows the impact this game had on the perception of this structure. All top players of that time considered White’s position to be strategically suspect and after } 13...Nf5 14.c3 { both Boleslavsky and Alekhine attempted to improve White’s play. Alekhine pessimistically stated ‘Because of the weak points in White’s position, it was essential to play actively.’ He analyzes: 14.Rac1 Nc6 Kasparov’s suggestion of 14...Nxe3 15.Qxe3 Nc6 is stronger, and that’s why Boleslavsky’s suggestion to start with 14.Bf2 is better. 15.Bf2 h5 16.c4 dxc4 17.Qxc4 O-O 18.Rfd1 when ‘White is no longer in danger of losing.’ In reality, there is absolutely nothing wrong with White’s position. I believe we have before us a typical case of the winner writing the history. Capablanca’s play in this game made such an impact that it blurred the judgement of the analysts. After Boleslavsky’s suggestion 14.Bf2 h5 instead of 15.Rac1 , White has many attractive options. For instance 15.Nc3 threatening Nxd5. 15.Ng3 Nxg3 16.Qxg3 provoking g6 is very interesting too. Modern engines like White’s position here and indeed the dark squares in Black’s camp are severely weakened. After, say, 17.Rac1 Nc6 18.h3 it is a strategically complex position. Castling is out of the question as White will move the queen and get g2-g4 and Bh4-f6 in. If, instead, Black gets Ne7-f5 followed by h5-h4, the position should be very fine. But after 18...Ne7 19.Qa3 b6 20.Rfd1 ! Nf5 21.c4 ! dxc4 22.Qa4+ Black is in huge trouble. It means that on move 18 it is difficult to find a move for Black. 15...Qc6 16.Nb5 a6 17.a4 !? Nd7 18.Nd4 Nxd4 19.Bxd4 is similar to 15.Ng3. A position where the natural rules of ‘bad bishop versus good knight’ don’t apply. White is doing well here too, with ideas of f4-f5 and Qg3. As a last note, it should be said that also in the game, after Nimzowitsch’s move, White is not even close to worse. } 14...Nc6 15.Rad1 { An odd move, Alekhine questions what the rook is doing on the d-file and that is indeed not easy to answer. 15.Bf2 ! was still the correct move, after which 15...h5 gives Black a satisfactory game. } 15...g6 { A very suspicious move which, however, lured White into making a positional blunder. } 16.g4 { A modern top player wouldn’t even consider this move. But it should be said that even for those times, this move was considered a shocker. Alekhine was ruthless: ‘An unbelievable move for a player of Nimzowitsch’s class: it deprives him of any chances on the kingside and rids the opponent of any fears regarding the dark squares in his position - and thereby grants Capablanca complete freedom on the queenside. Now White’s game is strategically lost.’ Once again, 16.Bf2 was the way to go. } 16...Nxe3 17.Qxe3 h5 18.g5 { Capitulation. White had two alternatives. 18.h3 hxg4 19.hxg4 O-O-O followed by Rh4 is just winning. The only fighting chance is 18.f5 ! when 18...gxf5 19.gxf5 Qxe5 20.Qxe5 Nxe5 21.Nd4 Kd7 22.Rde1 wins back the pawn. Black should instead play 19...O-O-O keeping a substantial advantage. } 18...O-O 19.Nd4 Qb6 20.Rf2 Rfc8 { With the kingside favourably closed, Black will now start play on the queenside. } 21.a3 Rc7 22.Rd3 Na5 { Kasparov rightly calls this a serious inaccuracy: ‘the idea of penetrating to c4 with the knight proves fundamentally incorrect.’ Alekhine proposed the plan: 22...Ne7 23.Rfd2 Rac8 24.Qf2 Qa6 followed by b5 , Qb6 , a5 and, eventually, b5-b4 looks much stronger indeed. The modern silicon solution is 22...Nxd4 23.Rxd4 Rc4 24.Rfd2 Rac8 25.Kg2 Qb3 when it’s very hard to stop a7-a5, b7-b5-b4 from happening. } 23.Re2 { Toying with the idea of throwing in f4-f5. } 23...Re8 { ‘Black was evidently convinced that 23...Nc4 24.Qf2 Nxa3 was dubious in view of 25.f5 !’ wrote Alekhine. Kasparov disagrees in ‘My Great Predecessors’ stating 25...gxf5 leads to a Black advantage following 26.g6 Nb5. In fact, 23...Nc4 24.Qf2 Nxa3 25.f5 gxf5 25...exf5 ! is the correct way to play. 26.Qh4 ! Nb5 27.Rg2 Nxd4 28.Rxd4 wins on the spot, meaning Alekhine’s instincts didn’t deceive him ! Given the nature of the position, Black being completely in control, Capablanca obviously wanted not to see any of these complications. } 24.Kg2 { 24.a4 ! was a good chance to improve White’s position. The immediate threat is Nd4-b5-d6, and after 24...a6 both 25.b4 and 25.f5 come into consideration. We see now the difficulties Capablanca created for himself with his knight manoeuvre. } 24...Nc6 { ‘Reverting to the correct path’ - Kasparov. } 25.Red2 { Alekhine and Kasparov again disagree, this time on the merits of 25.Nxc6 Qxc6 26.Rd4 which Alekhine considers a technically winning position, while Kasparov claims the exchange of knights would have eased White’s defence. Backed by modern engines I would once again side with Alekhine. It’s incredibly hard to find anything against Black’s plan of expansion on the queenside: 26...b5 and if White passes (what else is there to do ?) a7-a5, Qd8-b6, Kg8-g7, Re8-b8 and b5-b4 will come sooner or later. } 25...Rec8 { 25...Nxd4 ! 26.Rxd4 Rc5 followed by Qc6, and the usual b7-b5, a7-a5 etc. was strong too. } 26.Re2 { There is something to be said for 26.Nf3 !? offering a queen exchange. } 26...Ne7 { 26...Nxd4 would be similar to the note to Black’s 25th move. } 27.Red2 Rc4 28.Qh3 Kg7 29.Rf2 { 29.Qe3 ‘was more tenacious’- Kasparov } 29...a5 30.Re2 Nf5 { A good exchange, leaving Black with a technically winning position.

White has no counterplay whatsoever. } 31.Nxf5+ gxf5 32.Qf3 { 32.Qxh5 Rh8 33.Qf3 Rh4 loses on the spot and so does 32.g6 Rxf4 33.gxf7 h4 ! } 32...Kg6 33.Red2 { Some sort of last stand was probably 33.Rf2 Re4 34.Qd1 ! to have Rh3 if Black tries to penetrate with the c8-rook. } 33...Re4 34.Rd4 Rc4 35.Qf2 { 35.Rxc4 was a better fighting chance, since Rxc4 36.Qf2 !

Black is in fine shape. 6.Bd3 Strategically speaking, Black doesn’t mind exchanging these bishops and usually White only offers it with a concrete idea in mind.

White is overextended though and can be poked from all sides. The most likely plan is to play for a well-timed f7-f6. Black can prepare that with g7-g5, Bf8-g7 and O-O. Another option is to break the queenside, with moves like a7-a5 and b7-b6. Also the short term plan of dropping the bishop back to h7 followed by Ne7-f5 is something to always keep in mind.
